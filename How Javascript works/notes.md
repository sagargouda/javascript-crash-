1. evrything in Js happens in Execution conetxt
2. EC is like a big box where code is excuted
3. EC has 2 compennets in it
   i) memory component(variable environment) => all variables and functions are stored in key value pairs
   ii) code component (Thread of execution)

4) JS is a synchronous single-threaded language(one command at a time in a specific order)

5) javascript is a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

6) HIGH_LEVEL = low level languages like c needs developer to manage resources like memory management but js don't need to worry about that

7) Garbage-collection = so js has this special power where the runtime environment identifies and fress up memory ovvupied by unused objects so it helps manage memory efficiently

8) Interpreted or JIT = machine code is 0,1 and human code is what we write and more on this in next commit

9) MUlti paradigm = it is structure in which code is written
   i) procedural ii) oops iii) functional

   10)prototype based object oriented = evyrthing in js is objects execpt primitives so any array methods you see like array.push is just inherting array.prototype.push , so it was like blueprint

10) First class fucnitons = in javasctipt has fucntions which can return functions and send them as paramters to other funcitons because fucntions acts as parameters

12)Dynamic or loosely typed = no need of mentioning data type when decalring a varaiable

13. single - threade = one line at a time in synchronous order.
