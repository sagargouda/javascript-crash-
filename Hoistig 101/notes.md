1. hositing => it is a phenomena in js by which we can access variables and functions even before we itialized them without error

2) if we just did console.log(answer);
   we will get entire fucniton

3) diffrence between not defined and undefined , if there is no vairable tehn it is not defined and undefined is like placeholder

4) for arrow funciton we get error like it is not a fucniton , because js treats arrow and function expression as variables , so arrow fuction variable like normal variable stores undefined

5) so only for fucntion decalration has full hoisting behaviour not arrow and expressions , arrow and exspression have hositing behaviour realted to variable

6)
