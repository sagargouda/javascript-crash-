1. what is callback fucntions?
   => callbacks fucnitons gives access to asynchrornous world , the functions which passes other fucntions to a fucntion is called callback fucntion

2) call stack is like main thread
3) if any opeartions blovks main thread Blocking main thread ,

4) using web api's and callback fucntion helps us in async tasks

5) Closures provide a way to create private variables and maintain state between function calls.

6) garbage collection = we need to remove event listeners we do it because event listenerrsd aree heavy they take memory because they form closures right even when call stack is empty so there is no click event happineng right. good practice is to free up

7) It's a good practice to remove event listeners when they are no longer needed, especially in scenarios where elements are dynamically added and removed from the DOM.
   This can be done using the removeEventListener method or by using event delegation techniques.
