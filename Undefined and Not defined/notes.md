1. undefined is specail keyword in js
2. even before a line of code is executed js tries to allocate memory space for that variable and stores undefined

3) it is just a placeholder
4) if i try to console.log some variabel which is not declared and don't have memory allocated it gives error

5) undefined is not equal to empty
   6)for a even if we have not intialized even then we get undefined
